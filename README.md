# facial_emotion_recognition
Facial emotion recognition system developed using pattern recognition techniques and transfer learning to classify human emotions from facial images.


##  Objectives

* Collect and preprocess facial image data
* Apply pattern recognition techniques for emotion detection
* Train multiple CNN models using transfer learning
* Compare model performance across architectures
* Improve classification accuracy using data augmentation
* Document methodology and findings in a research paper



##  Models Used

The following pre-trained CNN architectures were implemented and evaluated:

* ResNet50
* InceptionV3
* MobileNetV2
* DenseNet121
* EfficientNetB1 



##  Best Model Performance

* **Model:** EfficientNetB1
* **Accuracy:** 96.6%
* **F1-Score:** 0.97

The model demonstrated superior performance in emotion classification across all evaluation metrics.



##  Dataset

A custom facial image dataset was collected and labeled into five emotion classes:

* Angry
* Fear
* Happy
* Sad
* Surprise

Data was split into training, validation, and testing sets for model development and evaluation.



##  Tools & Technologies

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Scikit-learn
* OpenCV
* NumPy & Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn



##  Techniques Applied

* Transfer Learning
* Fine-Tuning
* Data Augmentation
* Class Weighting
* Grad-CAM Visualization



## 📄 Research Paper

A research paper was developed to document the project methodology, experiments, model comparisons, and final results.
